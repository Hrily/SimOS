## Banker Algorithm

####Safety Sequence and resorce request

###Input
1-Safety Sequence 2-Resource Request 

For choice 1:

```
N
R
```

allocation matrix(N by R)

maximum matrix (N by R)

available matrix (R)

For choice 2:

```
N
R
```

allocation matrix(N by R)

maximum matrix (N by R)

available matrix (R)

Process no.

Request Matrix for process

N- Number of processes

R- Number of resource types


###Output

For choice 1:

Safety sequence exists: prints "Safe Sequence:" (space separated integers) 

If it doesn't exists: prints "Deadlock"

For choice 2:

If request is incompatible: prints "Request cannot be granted"

Safety sequence exists: prints the sequence(space separated integers) 

If it doesn't exists: prints "Deadlock"
