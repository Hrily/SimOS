## Banker Algorithm

#### Safety Sequence and resource request

### Input

```
N
R
```

allocation matrix(N by R)

maximum matrix (N by R)

available matrix (R)

Process no.

Request Matrix for process

N- Number of processes

R- Number of resource types


###Output



Safety sequence exists: prints "Safe Sequence:" (space separated integers) 

If it doesn't exists: prints "Deadlock"

If request is incompatible: prints "Request cannot be granted"

Safety sequence exists: prints the sequence(space separated integers) 

If it doesn't exists: prints "Deadlock"
